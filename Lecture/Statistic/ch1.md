## Engineering or Scientific method

1.  Describe a clear and concise description of problem

2.  Identify, at least tentatively, the importance factors that affect the problem.

3.  Propose the model for the problem using engineering knowledge of the phenomenon being studies.

4.  Conduct appropriate experiments and collect data to test.

5.  Refine the model on the basic of observed data.

6.  Manipulate the model to assist in developing a solution in the problem.

7.  Conduct an appropriate experimental to confirm that the proposed solution to the problem is both efficient and effective.

8.  Draw a conclusion or make recommendation.
